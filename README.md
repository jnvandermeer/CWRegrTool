This is a git repo of my EEGlab plugin for doing Carbon-Wire regression.

It's a way to remove movement artifacts out of the EEG while doing EEG-fMRI. You measure the movements with carbon-wires and use basic regression much like in fMRI analyses.

Todo:
1) Make 'contrasts' to select the most explaining time delays
2) Make the 'diagnostics' button function so you can monitor how things went (important for (1)).
3) Clean it up (delete unnecessary files)
4) Clean up the comments (maybe this will someday happen)
5) Create the pseudo-code and document it a bit better

Maybe skip # 4 and 5 altogether and do it in python.
